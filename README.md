# Words Per Minute (HUD)

This is a small app that uses the microphone and dictation APIs to listen to a speaker and show in real-time the number of words-per-minute being spoken.
It's intended to help parents and children who are working on improving reading speed, but could also be useful for nervous presenters who find themselves talking fast on stage, and want to practice maintaining a lower speaking rate.
